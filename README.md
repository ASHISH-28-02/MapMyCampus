## What is MapMyCampus?

**MapMyCampus** is more than just a map. It's a smart companion for campus life. You can ask it for directions, find specific buildings, or even ask general questions about the campus. Our goal is to make campus navigation intuitive, accessible, and maybe even a little bit fun.
